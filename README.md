# Micro-Java Instances

A simple Statix and SDF3 specification (in Spoofax 2) for a Micro-Java dialect that supports only integers, classes, instance fields and methods, member references, and method calls.
It does not enforce that variables are declared _before_ they are used, or that variable declarations are unique.

This is intended as a very simple example of what you can do using Spoofax.
